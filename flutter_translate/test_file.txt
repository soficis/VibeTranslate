This is a test file for the FlutterTranslate application.

Hello world! This is some sample English text that can be imported into the translation app and then translated through the backtranslation process: English → Japanese → English.

The file picker functionality allows you to select and import:
- .txt files (plain text)
- .md files (Markdown)
- .html files (with text extraction)

Try importing this file to see how the translation works!
