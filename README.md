# VibeTranslate üéâ

[![GitHub Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-soficis/VibeTranslate-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/soficis/VibeTranslate)

A collection of translation applications built in different languages and frameworks, all implementing the same core functionality: **English ‚Üî Japanese back-translation** for content quality evaluation and linguistic analysis.

## üåü Overview

VibeTranslate is a polyglot project showcasing how the same application can be implemented across multiple programming languages and UI frameworks. Each implementation maintains the same core features while leveraging language-specific strengths and platform capabilities.

### üéØ Core Functionality
- **Back-translation**: English ‚Üí Japanese ‚Üí English using Google Translate APIs
- **File Import**: Load text from .txt, .md, and .html files
- **Dual API Support**: Unofficial (free) and Official Google Cloud Translation API
- **Modern UI**: Dark/Light themes, responsive design, progress indicators
- **Export Features**: Save results, copy to clipboard, file operations

### ‚ú® Advanced Features
- **Batch Processing**: Process entire directories of text files (implemented in Python, Go, WinUI; available in others).
- **Quality Metrics (BLEU)**: Assess translation quality with BLEU scores (implemented in Python, Go, F#, WinUI, C#; integrated with export and batch processing).
- **Cost Tracking**: Track API usage costs and set monthly budgets (implemented in Python, Go, WinUI; with persistent storage).
- **Advanced Exporting**: Export to PDF, DOCX, and HTML with custom templates (implemented in Python, Go, WinUI; F# supports as undocumented feature).
- **Secure Storage**: Securely store API keys using platform-specific features (Go uses keyring with AES fallback; WinUI uses DPAPI).
- **EPUB Processing**: Extract and translate text from .epub files (implemented in Flutter, Go; disabled in C#, not in others).
- **Translation Memory**: Cache translations to improve performance and reduce costs (implemented in Python, Go, WinUI, C#; missing in F#, Flutter).

## üìÑ License

This project is provided for educational and development purposes. Usage of translation APIs should comply with respective terms of service.

## üîí Security Notes

- **Go Secure Storage**: Uses keyring for secure API key storage with AES encrypted file fallback. Key derivation for fallback is simple; recommend stronger derivation (e.g., PBKDF2) for production to address potential security gaps.
- All implementations use Google Translate APIs; ensure compliance with terms of service and handle API keys securely.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **Go GUI**: OpenGL build issues on Windows; CLI version works perfectly.
- **Feature Disparities**: Translation memory missing in F# and Flutter; EPUB processing disabled in C#; advanced exporting undocumented in F#.
